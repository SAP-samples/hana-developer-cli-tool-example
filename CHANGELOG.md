**Changed**

- Tested and made fixes for upcomming Node.js 16.x support. Tested under Node.js 16.9.0. You can use with Node.js 16, but will receive installation warnings and a warning on each command as the inner SAP supplied modules are technically not validated or supported yet on Node.js 16. However my local tests have been sucessful after some minor code changes. We will offically support Node.js 16 as soon as key SAP inner modules do as well
- Upgrade dependencies @sap/cds to 5.4.4 and SAPUI5 to 1.94.0
- New Command querySimpleUI - browser based UI for executing single SQL Statements

## [2.202109.1] - 2021-09-03

**Changed**

- Added status of hana cloud instance to output of command hc by [sbarzaghialteaup](https://github.com/sbarzaghialteaup) [Pull Request 64](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-developer-cli-tool-example/pull/64)
- Optimize performance for the inspectTable feature in the Browser based UI
- Switch to the UI5 CodeEditor for output in the inspectTable command in the Browser

## [2.202108.4] - 2021-08-25

**Changed**

- querySimple Export to CSV Format feature added by [sbarzaghialteaup](https://github.com/sbarzaghialteaup)
- Update Dependencies - especially HANA Client to 2.9.28
- Update to SAPUI5 1.93.0
- Convert entire project to ECMAScript Modules (ESM) - this is a massive internal change and we appologize in advance if it results in any instablity. If you hit any issues please report then you can target specifically the last version until they are resolved

## [2.202108.1] - 2021-08-06

**Changed**

- Update dependencies - especially SAP Cloud Application Programming Model to 5.4.1
- Trimmed several unused dependencies in an effort to keep hana-cli as slim as possible
- Remove @sap/cds-dk as a direct dependency. To use the openAPI features in commands like inspectTable, inspectView or cds; you must have @sap/cds-dk globally. But most development environments where this option would be used should already have @sap/cds-dk installed this way.  Remove many unneded depenencies and duplicated modules from hana-cli most importantly removing the sqlite3 depenency that was never used but caused lots of install issues.
- New Browser UI for indexesUI and inspectTableUI

## [2.202107.6] - 2021-07-30

**Changed**

- Add a devcontainer configuration to allow contributors or testers of this project to start in a remote container or CodeSpaces with all necessary tools (like cf, @sap/cds-dk, etc) and VSCode extensions preinstalled. [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and [https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/configuring-codespaces-for-your-project)
- Improved error handling in the Browser Based UI especially during start up scenarios where a default-env.json or equivelant is missing.
- Add Web Assistant embedded help and changelog
- Add full in-app assistance for massConvert command

## [2.202107.5] - 2021-07-27

**Changed**

- Add node.js engines version check on startup and output a warning if there is a mismatch based upon the engines specification in package.json
- Add busy indicator in browser based UI
- massConvert to HDBTABLE or HDBMIGRATIONTABLE with the useCatalogPure option now removes CS_* Types from the output for compatibility with target SAP HANA Cloud systems
- massConvert to HDBTABLE or HDBMIGRATIONTABLE without the useCatalogPure option also includes associations now. However when coming from HDBCDS based sources the column names contain dots which are incompatible with CAP CDS. The associations will still have the old column names while the rest of the table defition must replace the dot with underscore or recieve CDS Compiler errors.  I will leave this functionality in place, although imperfect. If you have associations in your source system, strongly consider using the useCatalogPure option instead. 
- Added new commands featuresUI, featureUsageUI, functionsUI, hdiUI, sbssUI, schemaInstancesUI, schemaInstancesUI, securestoreUI, and upsUI

## [2.202107.4] - 2021-07-27

**Changed**

- version command returned error due to change in latest-version. Reverted to old version of the module
- Rebuilt npm shrinkwrap due to some install errors with Sqlite3 - errors can be ignored as they don't impact hana-cli but still rather not show errors if possible

## [2.202107.3] - 2021-07-26

**Changed**

- Allow quoted names in massConvert when the target is HDBTABLE
- UI theme (light or dark) will now adjust automatically to user's OS setting
- New commands: containersUI, dataTypesUI, schemasUI, and tablesUI
- Refactored list operations (like schemas, tables, etc) to allow them to be reused in the new Browser UI

## [2.202107.2] - 2021-07-21

**Changed**

- Upgrade to @sap/cds 5.3.1, @sap/hana-client 2.9.23, @sap/hdbext 7.3.0, and sap-hdbext-promisifed 2.202107.1
- Major addition of new browser based UIs for certain complex commands.  First focus is on the massConvert command. No new external depencencies.  We launch Express web server from the CLI and then open the web browser.  You can complete the command with visual options, value help and extended documentation. Command is still executed in the CLI and the output is piped to the web broswer using web sockets.
- New commands: massConvertUI, systemInfoUI, changesUI, readMeUI, and UI (last one opens a LaunchPad with tiles for all the other commands)

## [2.202107.1] - 2021-07-13

**Changed**

## [2.202105.8] - 2021-05-25

- Increase the page size for the xs/cf services commands (ups and hdi) [Issue #40](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-developer-cli-tool-example/issues/40)

- [Issue #38 - Add support for hdbmigrationtable in massConvert and inspectTable](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-developer-cli-tool-example/issues/38)
- Add option useCatalogPure to massConvert command. Defaults to false and uses the cds.compile api to produce its hdbtable or hdbmigrationtable output. When set to true it will instead use the HANA SYS.GET_OBJECT_DEFINITION which includes more metadata but might produce results which are incompatible with HDI
- Remove the Schema from output of massConvert commands

## [2.202105.3] - 2021-05-10

- Fix not a function error in inspectView with output option of openapi
- swagger-jsdoc output format, which is actually commented YAML version of openAPI, added to inspectTable and inspectView

## [2.202104.2] - 2021-04-23

**Changed**

- Match the @sap/hdbext and @sap/hana-client versions exactly to remove duplicate copies of the HANA Client in node_modules removing about 135Mb from the footprint of this tool overall
- Major internal refactoring to streamline the code and reduce duplication. Reusable base code for basic handling of Yargs and Prompts. Consistent error handling and other general stability improvments
- The default-env*.json file no longer needs to be in the same directory in which you are running the command.  If not found in the current directory, the tool will search in up to 5 parent directories to find it
- New parameter --conn added to most commands that allow you specify any filename you want to override the default-env.json. conn can specify a file in the current directory, up to 5 parent directories or in your ${homedir}/.hana-cli/ folder
- New parameter --quiet that disables extra output and human readable formatting for when you want to script commands and get pure results output
- New parameter --debug - for troubleshooting of the hana-cli tool itself. It will produce a LOT of detailed output. Nice if you are curious what queries are being sent to SAP to fullfill a command
- Options in the help are now grouped by Conneciton Parameters, Troubleshooting, and Options
- New order of processing for making connections as follows: 
- First we look for the Admin option and use a default-env-admin.json - this overrides all other parameters
- If no admin option or if there was an admin option but no default-env-admin.json could be found in this directory or 5 parent directories then look for a .env file in this directory or up to 5 parent directories
- No .env file found or it doesn't contain a VCAP_SERVICES section, then check to see if the --conn parameter was specified. If so check for that file in the current directory or up to 5 parent directories
- If the file specified via the --conn parameter wasn't found locally then check for it in the ${homedir}/.hana-cli/ folder
- If no specific configuration file was was found then look for a file named default-env.json in the current directory or up to 5 parent directories
- Last resort if nothing has been found up to this point - look for a file named default.json in the ${homedir}/.hana-cli/ folder
- Add Syntax Highlighting to various command outputs
