            Enter the name of the view you want to inspect. You can type the view name directly or use the suggestion 
            feature to search for available views in the selected schema.

        <p class="p">
            The view name is case-sensitive. If you're unsure of the exact name, start typing and suggestions will appear 
            showing matching view names from your database schema. Once you select or enter a view name and execute the 
            inspection, the tool will retrieve and display comprehensive metadata about the view structure and definition.
