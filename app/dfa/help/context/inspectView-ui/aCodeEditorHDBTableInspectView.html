        <p class="shortdesc">HDBTable Format Display</p>
        <p class="p">
            This code editor displays the view definition in HDBView format (shown as HDBTable tab for consistency), 
            which is the native SAP HANA design-time artifact format used in HANA Development projects and HDI 
            (HANA Deployment Infrastructure) containers.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            The HDBView format is a structured notation that defines view logic using HANA-specific syntax. 
            You can use this definition to:
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Create .hdbview artifacts in SAP Web IDE or Business Application Studio</li>
            <li class="li">Deploy views via HDI containers</li>
            <li class="li">Maintain view definitions in version control systems</li>
            <li class="li">Migrate existing runtime views to design-time artifacts</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">
            HDBView format is particularly useful in modern SAP HANA development workflows where database objects are 
            managed as design-time artifacts rather than runtime objects. Copy this definition to create a corresponding 
            .hdbview file in your project.
