            Enable this quiet mode option to suppress verbose output and detailed logging messages. When enabled, the tool 
            will only display essential information and results, making the output cleaner and more concise.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            This is useful in production environments or when you want to reduce the amount of diagnostic information 
            displayed in the console. The tool will still show errors and warnings, but detailed execution logs will be suppressed.
