        <p class="shortdesc">HDBView Format</p>
        <p class="p">
            The HDBTable tab shows the view definition in .hdbview format, which is the native HANA database artifact 
            format used in HANA Deployment Infrastructure (HDI) and SAP Business Application Studio.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            This format is used for defining design-time database artifacts that are deployed to HANA. If you're working 
            with HDI containers or developing HANA database modules, you can use this output to create or update hdbview 
            artifacts in your project. Note: despite the tab label "HDBTable", this shows the view-specific format.
