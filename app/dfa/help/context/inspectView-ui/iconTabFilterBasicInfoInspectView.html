        <p class="p">
            The Basic Info tab displays fundamental metadata about the selected view. This includes the view name, 
            schema name, view type (e.g., SQL View, Calculation View), and the view's object identifier (OID).
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Additional information shown includes whether the view has parameters (for analytic views), structured 
            privilege checks, result caching enabled, and the view creation timestamp. This information helps you 
            understand the view's configuration and characteristics at a glance.
