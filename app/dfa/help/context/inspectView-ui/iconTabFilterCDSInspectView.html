        <p class="shortdesc">CDS Definition Format</p>
        <p class="p">
            The CDS tab displays the view definition in Core Data Services (CDS) format, which is used in SAP Cloud 
            Application Programming (CAP) model and SAP HANA development.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            CDS provides a more abstract, domain-driven way to define data models and views compared to raw SQL. 
            This format is particularly useful when working with CAP applications, enabling data modeling, or migrating 
            view definitions to a CDS-based development approach. CDS views offer additional features like associations 
            and annotations.
