        <p class="p">
            This code editor displays the Core Data Services (CDS) view definition for the inspected view. CDS is 
            a modeling language used in SAP development environments, particularly in SAP HANA and CAP (Cloud Application Programming Model).
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            The generated CDS definition includes view syntax with all fields, types, associations, and annotations. 
            You can use this CDS notation to:
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Create CDS views in your CAP or HANA projects</li>
            <li class="li">Integrate with SAP CAP applications</li>
            <li class="li">Document view structure in CDS format</li>
            <li class="li">Generate entity definitions for SAP Fiori applications</li>
            <li class="li">Leverage modern SAP development paradigms</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">
            The CDS representation provides a more modern, abstracted view of the database object compared to traditional 
            SQL DDL. Copy the definition for use in your CDS modeling projects.
