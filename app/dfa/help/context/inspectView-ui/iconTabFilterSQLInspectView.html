            The SQL tab shows the complete SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) CREATE VIEW statement that would recreate 
            this view.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            This includes the full SELECT statement that defines the view logic, column list, and any view-specific 
            options. You can copy this SQL statement to recreate the view in another database, use it for documentation, 
            understand the view's logic, or modify it for creating similar views. The generated SQL follows HANA SQL 
            syntax standards.
