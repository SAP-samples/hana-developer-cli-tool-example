            This field displays the schema name of the inspected view. This information is retrieved from the database 
            metadata and shows which schema contains the view you're currently viewing.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            The schema name is read-only in the Basic Info tab, as it's part of the view's metadata. This value corresponds 
            to the schema you selected in the input form at the top of the page.
