        <p class="shortdesc">View Classification</p>
        <p class="p">
            This field displays the type or classification of the view. Common values include <span class="ph uicontrol">VIEW</span> 
            for standard views, <span class="ph uicontrol">CALC</span> for calculation views, <span class="ph uicontrol">OLAP</span> 
            for analytical views, and <span class="ph uicontrol">JOIN</span> for join views.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            The view type determines how the view is processed and optimized by SAP HANA. Calculation views are modeling 
            constructs that can include complex business logic, while standard SQL views are simpler query abstractions 
            over base tables.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Understanding the view type helps you optimize query performance and choose the appropriate modeling approach 
            for your use case.
