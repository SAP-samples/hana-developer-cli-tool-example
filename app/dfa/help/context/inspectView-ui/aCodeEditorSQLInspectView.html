        <p class="p">
            This code editor displays the SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) CREATE VIEW statement for the inspected 
            view. The SQL DDL is automatically generated based on the view's metadata and definition.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            The generated SQL statement includes the complete view query, all column selections, joins, filters, and 
            other logic. You can use this SQL to:
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Recreate the view in another database or schema</li>
            <li class="li">Document the view logic</li>
            <li class="li">Compare view definitions across environments</li>
            <li class="li">Generate migration scripts</li>
            <li class="li">Understand the view's underlying query logic</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">
            The SQL code is syntax-highlighted for readability. You can copy the entire statement and execute it in 
            your preferred SQL tool or save it for version control purposes.
