            This field displays the timestamp when the view was originally created in the database. The timestamp 
            includes both date and time information in the database's time zone.

        <p class="p">
            The creation time is useful for tracking when database objects were added, which can be important for 
            auditing, version control, and understanding the evolution of your database schema over time.
