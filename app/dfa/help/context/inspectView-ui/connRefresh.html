        <p class="p">
            Click this button to refresh and reload your database connection. This is useful when you have changed 
            connection parameters, switched connection files, or need to re-establish a connection that may have timed out.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Refreshing the connection will read the current connection file settings and establish a new connection to 
            the database. Any changes you made to the connection file or admin settings will be applied when the connection 
            is refreshed.
