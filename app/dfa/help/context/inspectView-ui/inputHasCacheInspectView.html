            This field indicates whether the view has result caching enabled. The value will be <span class="ph uicontrol">TRUE</span> 
            if caching is active, or <span class="ph uicontrol">FALSE</span> if results are not cached.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            View caching stores query results in memory, allowing subsequent queries to retrieve data from the cache 
            rather than re-executing the view's underlying logic. This can significantly improve performance for frequently 
            accessed views with expensive computations or complex joins.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Cached results are automatically invalidated when underlying data changes, ensuring data freshness. However, 
            there may be a brief delay between data updates and cache refresh, so caching is best suited for views where 
            slightly delayed updates are acceptable.
