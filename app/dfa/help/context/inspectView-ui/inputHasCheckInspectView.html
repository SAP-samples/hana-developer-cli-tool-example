            This field indicates whether the view has a structured privilege check enabled. The value will be 
            <span class="ph uicontrol">TRUE</span> if structured privilege checking is active, or <span class="ph uicontrol">FALSE</span> otherwise.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Structured privilege checks provide fine-grained access control at the view level, allowing different users 
            to see different subsets of data based on their assigned privileges. This is a powerful security feature in 
            SAP HANA for implementing row-level security and data protection policies.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            When enabled, the view will automatically filter results based on the current user's privileges, ensuring 
            that sensitive data is protected without requiring application-level security logic.
