        <p class="shortdesc">SAP HANA Database Name</p>
        <p class="p">
            The logical name of the HANA database instance you are connected to. In multi-tenant database container (MDC) 
            environments, this identifies the specific tenant database.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            In single-container systems, this is typically 'SYSTEMDB' for the system database or matches the SID for the 
            tenant database. This helps you verify that you are connected to the correct database, especially important 
            when working with multiple tenants or instances.
