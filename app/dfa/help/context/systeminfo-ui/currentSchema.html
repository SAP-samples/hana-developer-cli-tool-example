        <p class="shortdesc">Current Database Schema Context</p>
        <p class="p">
            Shows the default database schema that is active for the current session. When you execute queries without 
            explicitly specifying a schema, this is the schema that will be used.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            The current schema determines which database objects (tables, views, procedures, etc.) are accessible by default. 
            This schema context can be different from the user name, allowing you to work in schemas that you have been 
            granted access to.
