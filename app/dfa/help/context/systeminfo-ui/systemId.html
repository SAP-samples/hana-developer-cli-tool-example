        <p class="p">
            The System ID (SID) is a unique three-character identifier for the HANA system. This identifier is assigned 
            during system installation and is used to distinguish between different HANA systems in your landscape.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            The SID is an important reference when working with multiple HANA instances, performing system administration 
            tasks, or when troubleshooting issues with SAP support.
