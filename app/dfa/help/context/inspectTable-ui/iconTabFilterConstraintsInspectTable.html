        <p class="shortdesc">Table Constraints</p>
        <p class="p">
            The Constraints tab displays all constraints defined on the table, including primary keys, foreign keys, 
            unique constraints, and check constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            For each constraint, you'll see the constraint name, type, and which columns are involved. Foreign key 
            constraints also show the referenced table and columns. Understanding constraints is essential for data 
            integrity and relationships between tables.
