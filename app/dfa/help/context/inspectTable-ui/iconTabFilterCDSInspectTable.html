        <p class="shortdesc">CDS Definition Format</p>
        <p class="p">
            The CDS tab displays the table definition in Core Data Services (CDS) format, which is used in SAP Cloud 
            Application Programming (CAP) model and SAP HANA development.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            CDS provides a more abstract, domain-driven way to define data models compared to raw SQL. This format is 
            particularly useful when working with CAP applications, enabling data modeling, or migrating table 
            definitions to a CDS-based development approach.
