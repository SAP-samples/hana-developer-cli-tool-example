            Enable this option to connect to the database using administrative privileges. This allows you to inspect 
            tables and access metadata that may not be available with regular user permissions.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            When enabled, the connection will use administrative credentials configured in your connection profile. 
            This is useful when you need to inspect system tables or tables in schemas where you don't have regular user access.

            <span class="ph uicontrol">Note:</span> Administrative credentials must be properly configured in your 
            connection file for this option to work. Changing this setting will refresh the connection.
