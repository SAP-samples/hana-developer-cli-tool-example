        <p class="p">
            Enable this option to activate debug mode, which provides detailed diagnostic information, execution logs, 
            and troubleshooting data. This is useful for investigating issues or understanding the internal operations 
            of the tool.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            When debug mode is enabled, you'll see additional information such as SQL queries being executed, connection 
            details, and internal processing steps. This verbosity can help diagnose problems but may produce a large 
            amount of output.

            <span class="ph uicontrol">Note:</span> Debug mode is primarily intended for development and troubleshooting. 
            It's recommended to disable it during normal operation.
