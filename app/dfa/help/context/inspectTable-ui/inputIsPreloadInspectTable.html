        <p class="p">
            This field indicates whether the table is configured for preloading into memory during database startup. 
            The value will be <span class="ph uicontrol">TRUE</span> if preload is enabled, or <span class="ph uicontrol">FALSE</span> otherwise.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Preloading ensures that table data is loaded into memory immediately when the SAP HANA database starts, 
            rather than waiting for the first query to access it. This can significantly improve the performance of 
            initial queries against the table.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Preload is typically enabled for frequently accessed tables where fast initial response time is critical. 
            However, it increases database startup time and memory consumption.
