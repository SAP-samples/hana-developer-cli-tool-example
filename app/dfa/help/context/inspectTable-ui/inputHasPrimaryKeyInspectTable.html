            This field indicates whether the table has a primary key defined. The value will be <span class="ph uicontrol">TRUE</span>

            A primary key is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in the table. Primary keys 
            are essential for ensuring data integrity and establishing relationships between tables. They also improve 
            query performance by creating indexes automatically.

            If the table has a primary key, you can view its details in the <span class="ph uicontrol">Constraints</span> tab.
