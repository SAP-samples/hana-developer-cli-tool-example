        <p class="shortdesc">Table Storage Type</p>
        <p class="p">
            This field displays the storage type of the table. Common values include <span class="ph uicontrol">ROW</span> 
            for row-store tables, <span class="ph uicontrol">COLUMN</span> for column-store tables, and <span class="ph uicontrol">GLOBAL TEMPORARY</span> 
            for temporary tables.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            The table type determines how data is physically stored in SAP HANA. Column-store tables are optimized for 
            analytical queries and compression, while row-store tables are optimized for transactional workloads with 
            frequent inserts and updates.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Understanding the table type helps you optimize query performance and storage efficiency for your specific use case.
