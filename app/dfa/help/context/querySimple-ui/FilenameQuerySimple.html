        <p class="p">
            Optionally specify a filename for the exported query results. If you leave this field empty, a filename 
            will be automatically generated based on the current timestamp.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            You should not include the file extension in the filename - it will be added automatically based on the 
            selected output format. For example, if you enter "CustomerData" and select JSON as the output type, 
            the final file will be named "CustomerData.json".
