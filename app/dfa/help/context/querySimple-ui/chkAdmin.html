            Enable this option to connect to the database using administrative privileges. This allows you to execute 
            queries that may require elevated permissions or access system tables and metadata that are not available 
            with regular user permissions.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            When enabled, the connection will use administrative credentials configured in your connection profile. 
            This is useful when you need to query system views, perform administrative operations, or access data in 
            schemas where you don't have regular user access.

            <span class="ph uicontrol">Note:</span> Administrative credentials must be properly configured in your 
            connection file for this option to work. Changing this setting will refresh the connection.
