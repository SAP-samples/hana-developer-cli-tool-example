            Specify the target folder path where query results will be saved when exporting to a file format. 
            This folder is relative to where the hana-cli command was started from the terminal.

            The folder must be accessible and writable. If the folder doesn't exist, it will be created automatically 
            when you export results. By default, this is set to the current working directory (.). You can specify a 
            subfolder like "output" or "exports" to organize your exported query results.
