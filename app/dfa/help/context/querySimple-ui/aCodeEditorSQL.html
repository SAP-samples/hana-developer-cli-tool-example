        <p class="p">
            Enter your SQL query in this code editor. The editor provides syntax highlighting for SQL to make it easier 
            to write and read queries. You can write SELECT statements to retrieve data from tables and views.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            The editor supports multi-line queries, so you can format your SQL for readability with proper indentation 
            and line breaks. You can use all standard HANA SQL syntax including JOINs, WHERE clauses, aggregations, 
            and subqueries. After entering your query, click the execute button in the toolbar to run it and see results 
            in the table below.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            Note: Only SELECT queries are typically executed. DDL (CREATE, DROP, ALTER) and DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) 
            statements may be restricted depending on your permissions and the tool configuration.
