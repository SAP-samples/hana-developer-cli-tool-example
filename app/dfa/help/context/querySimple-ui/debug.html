        <p class="p">
            Enable this option to activate debug mode, which provides detailed diagnostic information, execution logs, 
            and troubleshooting data. This is useful for investigating issues or understanding the internal operations 
            of the query execution.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
            When debug mode is enabled, you'll see additional information such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">Query execution plans and optimization details</li>
            <li class="li">Connection details and parameters</li>
            <li class="li">Timing information for query execution</li>
            <li class="li">Internal processing steps and data transformations</li>
            <li class="li">Any warnings or informational messages</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="p">
            <span class="ph uicontrol">Note:</span> Debug mode is primarily intended for development and troubleshooting. 
            It's recommended to disable it during normal operation as it may produce a large amount of output.
